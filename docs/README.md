# EEG viewer

Plots EEGs recorded with the Attys (http://www.attys.tech)
using the Dygraphs (http://dygraphs.com)
library and jquery (https://jquery.com/).

For example within AttysEEG you can share the recorded 
EEG via e-mail or google drive and then the recipient simply drops the 
EEG file into this EEG viewer.

The EEG viewer allows panning, zooming and you can create printouts
by simply using the print option of your web browser.
